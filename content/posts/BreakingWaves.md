Sun shining on the blue seas,<br>
Inviting me in despite my fears,<br>
The warm air beats cold waters,<br>
A summer of hope is here.<br>

Waves crashing, churning, drowning,<br>
Sending me back, many strokes,<br>
Giving in, diving, tumbling, paddling,<br>
I try again, to get past the breaking waves.<br>

Maybe I am not strong enough,<br>
To get to where I can start to surf,<br>
To fail in all the right ways,<br>
And finally, get a chance to learn.<br>

Stop trying, it's time to give up,<br>
Let the ocean carry me to shores,<br>
Feel the warmth instead, lying in the sun,<br>
Mastering the art of letting go.<br>
