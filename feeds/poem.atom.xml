Makes me feel guilty,&lt;br&gt;
I worry about my kids,&lt;br&gt;
Even when she loves me,&lt;br&gt;
Moving on still hurts,&lt;br&gt;
When I see your tears,&lt;br&gt;
I am not the devil you see,&lt;br&gt;
Just a fallen angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart knows I tried,&lt;br&gt;
To not shake the den,&lt;br&gt;
I sat all those nights,&lt;br&gt;
Thinking about them,&lt;br&gt;
You never saw me cry,&lt;br&gt;
I worked  it out myself,&lt;br&gt;
I am just a human being,&lt;br&gt;
Another fallen angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get off your high ground,,&lt;br&gt;
And come talk to me,&lt;br&gt;
It doesn't matter how,&lt;br&gt;
We ended up here,&lt;br&gt;
You need to carry on,&lt;br&gt;
Past your should bes,&lt;br&gt;
And let me go for real,&lt;br&gt;
Your fallen angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry><entry><title>How I got there</title><link href="/2019/02/how-i-got-there-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-18T10:20:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T17:06:24-07:00</updated><author><name>Sohani Rao</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-02-18:/2019/02/how-i-got-there-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's an attempt to stay positive...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The path disappears again,&lt;br&gt;
Faces blurring into one another,&lt;br&gt;
Gasping for air, I look down,&lt;br&gt;
The depth of the fall is horrific,&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I am wrong to keep going,&lt;br&gt;
Maybe someone else spoke my words,&lt;br&gt;
I am all I need though,&lt;br&gt;
No man to save the day,&lt;br&gt;
But he just might, at the right time and place,&lt;br&gt;
Breathing life onto a journey still in the making,&lt;br&gt;
Just enough to keep me going for a bit longer,&lt;br&gt;
And then dropping me down this cliff,&lt;br&gt;
into a void so I can find myself all over again.&lt;br&gt;
Let it go, let it be, &lt;br&gt;
those words of wisdom,&lt;br&gt;
fail to comfort me, &lt;br&gt;
I know it's going to be okay,&lt;br&gt;
After darkness comes another day,&lt;br&gt;
and with it comes a possibility, just a possibility&lt;br&gt;
that I'll make it, out of this tunnel and into the light&lt;br&gt;
but this time, know exactly how I got there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry><entry><title>Goodbyes on the camino</title><link href="/2018/12/goodbyes-on-the-camino-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-26T10:20:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-08-08T18:40:02-07:00</updated><author><name>Sohani Rao</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-12-26:/2018/12/goodbyes-on-the-camino-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by my hike to Camino de Santaigo along Camino de Frances in Christmas 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took a thousands steps, and I sat down,&lt;br&gt;
Think I'll just give this race up and take my bow,&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I am one of the lucky ones that got left out,&lt;br&gt;
Whatever season it was, it is over now&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The sun will rise tomorrow and you will walk again,&lt;br&gt;
But I'll be packing my bags to go home instead,&lt;br&gt;
Yes you and I are not longer on the same page,&lt;br&gt;
But I am grateful for everything we did share&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Goodbye my darling, you are the love of my life,&lt;br&gt;
I'll think of who I was when you were by my side,&lt;br&gt;
I will weave every memory of us into a cozy blanket,&lt;br&gt;
And wear it to comfort me on these cold nights&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before I go, there something you need to know,&lt;br&gt;
I gave it everything I had and then some more,&lt;br&gt;
That's why I can now walk away without remorse,&lt;br&gt;
Even when it hurts and cuts deep into my soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don't worry about me, I will be okay,&lt;br&gt;
I am a fighter, a survivor as you say,&lt;br&gt;
Hug me a last time and wish me bon voyage,&lt;br&gt;
We should have said goodbye, when we had "a way"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry><entry><title>Before the dawn breaks</title><link href="/2018/06/before-the-dawn-breaks-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-18T10:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T17:05:57-07:00</updated><author><name>Sohani Rao</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-06-18:/2018/06/before-the-dawn-breaks-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's power in community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ready for the last mile,&lt;br&gt;
Rising before the dawn breaks,&lt;br&gt;
Putting one foot in front of another,&lt;br&gt;
A light guiding our way,&lt;br&gt;
Feeling the pain of the past,&lt;br&gt;
And all that went wrong,&lt;br&gt;
Hand in hand in hand in hand,&lt;br&gt;
We march on strong,&lt;br&gt;
The gates will open wide,&lt;br&gt;
Our path will appear,&lt;br&gt;
The sun will shine so bright,&lt;br&gt;
The moon will disappear,&lt;br&gt;
As we reach the summit,&lt;br&gt;
The clouds bow down,&lt;br&gt;
Purple velvet turns crimson,&lt;br&gt;
And the future joins us,&lt;br&gt;
Out of air and out of breath,&lt;br&gt;
Take a moment to see,&lt;br&gt;
That we are the love we seek,&lt;br&gt;
And that we were always here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry><entry><title>Breaking waves</title><link href="/2018/06/breaking-waves-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-18T10:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T17:06:08-07:00</updated><author><name>Sohani Rao</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-06-18:/2018/06/breaking-waves-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I once tried to learn how to surf, and...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sun shining on the blue seas,&lt;br&gt;
Inviting me in despite my fears,&lt;br&gt;
The warm air beats cold waters,&lt;br&gt;
A summer of hope is here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waves crashing, churning, drowning,&lt;br&gt;
Sending me back, many strokes,&lt;br&gt;
Giving in, diving, tumbling, paddling,&lt;br&gt;
I try again, to get past the breaking waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am not strong enough,&lt;br&gt;
To get to where I can start to surf,&lt;br&gt;
To fail in all the right ways,&lt;br&gt;
And finally, get a chance to learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop trying, it's time to give up,&lt;br&gt;
Let the ocean carry me to shores,&lt;br&gt;
Feel the warmth instead, lying in the sun,&lt;br&gt;
Mastering the art of letting go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry></feed>
