Faces blurring into one another,&lt;br&gt;
Gasping for air, I look down,&lt;br&gt;
The depth of the fall is horrific,&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I am wrong to keep going,&lt;br&gt;
Maybe someone else spoke my words,&lt;br&gt;
I am all I need though,&lt;br&gt;
No man to save the day,&lt;br&gt;
But he just might, at the right time and place,&lt;br&gt;
Breathing life onto a journey still in the making,&lt;br&gt;
Just enough to keep me going for a bit longer,&lt;br&gt;
And then dropping me down this cliff,&lt;br&gt;
into a void so I can find myself all over again.&lt;br&gt;
Let it go, let it be, &lt;br&gt;
those words of wisdom,&lt;br&gt;
fail to comfort me, &lt;br&gt;
I know it's going to be okay,&lt;br&gt;
After darkness comes another day,&lt;br&gt;
and with it comes a possibility, just a possibility&lt;br&gt;
that I'll make it, out of this tunnel and into the light&lt;br&gt;
but this time, know exactly how I got there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry><entry><title>Before the dawn breaks</title><link href="/2018/06/before-the-dawn-breaks-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-18T10:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T17:05:57-07:00</updated><author><name>Sohani Rao</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-06-18:/2018/06/before-the-dawn-breaks-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's power in community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ready for the last mile,&lt;br&gt;
Rising before the dawn breaks,&lt;br&gt;
Putting one foot in front of another,&lt;br&gt;
A light guiding our way,&lt;br&gt;
Feeling the pain of the past,&lt;br&gt;
And all that went wrong,&lt;br&gt;
Hand in hand in hand in hand,&lt;br&gt;
We march on strong,&lt;br&gt;
The gates will open wide,&lt;br&gt;
Our path will appear,&lt;br&gt;
The sun will shine so bright,&lt;br&gt;
The moon will disappear,&lt;br&gt;
As we reach the summit,&lt;br&gt;
The clouds bow down,&lt;br&gt;
Purple velvet turns crimson,&lt;br&gt;
And the future joins us,&lt;br&gt;
Out of air and out of breath,&lt;br&gt;
Take a moment to see,&lt;br&gt;
That we are the love we seek,&lt;br&gt;
And that we were always here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry><entry><title>Breaking waves</title><link href="/2018/06/breaking-waves-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-18T10:20:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T17:06:08-07:00</updated><author><name>Sohani Rao</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-06-18:/2018/06/breaking-waves-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I once tried to learn how to surf, and...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sun shining on the blue seas,&lt;br&gt;
Inviting me in despite my fears,&lt;br&gt;
The warm air beats cold waters,&lt;br&gt;
A summer of hope is here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waves crashing, churning, drowning,&lt;br&gt;
Sending me back, many strokes,&lt;br&gt;
Giving in, diving, tumbling, paddling,&lt;br&gt;
I try again, to get past the breaking waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am not strong enough,&lt;br&gt;
To get to where I can start to surf,&lt;br&gt;
To fail in all the right ways,&lt;br&gt;
And finally, get a chance to learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop trying, it's time to give up,&lt;br&gt;
Let the ocean carry me to shores,&lt;br&gt;
Feel the warmth instead, lying in the sun,&lt;br&gt;
Mastering the art of letting go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="poem"></category><category term="poem"></category></entry></feed>
